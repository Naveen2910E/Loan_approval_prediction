# Loan_approval_prediction

# This repository contains a Loan Approval Prediction project that explores how applicant profile and credit information can be used to automatically predict loan approval using machine learning. The notebook covers the full workflow from data loading and exploratory analysis through feature preprocessing, training multiple tree-based and ensemble models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), hyperparameter tuning, and performance comparison, achieving about 91% accuracy on unseen data
